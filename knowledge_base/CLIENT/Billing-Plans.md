## How Billing Works

### Payment Processing

NovaPulse uses **Stripe** for secure payment processing. Stripe is used by millions of businesses worldwide and handles your payment information with bank-level security.

- All payments are processed through Stripe -- NovaPulse never sees or stores your full credit card number
- Payments are in **USD**
- Receipts are sent to your email automatically

### Billing Cycle

- You are billed on the **same date each month** (the date you started your subscription)
- Your subscription renews automatically unless you cancel
- If your payment fails, Stripe will retry a few times before pausing your subscription
