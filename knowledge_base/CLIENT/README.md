## A Note on Safety

NovaPulse is built with safety as the top priority. Multiple layers of protection -- stop losses, daily loss limits, circuit breakers, exposure caps, and more -- work together to guard your capital. We strongly recommend starting in **paper trading mode** (simulated trades with no real money) to get comfortable before going live.

Trading cryptocurrency involves risk. NovaPulse is a tool that helps you trade more systematically, but no system can guarantee profits. Please read the [Risk and Safety](Risk-Safety.md) guide and the [FAQ](FAQ.md) for a clear-eyed discussion of risk.
