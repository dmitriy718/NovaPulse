## What to Include in Your Support Request

To help us resolve your issue as quickly as possible, please include:

### For All Issues

2. **The date and time** of the issue (include your timezone, or use UTC)
3. **What you observed** -- describe what happened in your own words
4. **What you expected** -- what should have happened instead?
5. **Current dashboard status** -- RUNNING, PAUSED, STOPPED, STALE FEED, or OFFLINE
6. **A screenshot** of the dashboard (the overview and any relevant panels)

### For Trading Issues

In addition to the above:

9. **Whether you are in paper or live mode**

## Emergency vs. Non-Emergency

### Emergency (Immediate Action Needed)

An emergency is any situation where you believe:

- Your API credentials may be compromised
- The bot is placing unexpected or erroneous trades
- Trades are being placed in live mode when you expected paper mode
- You cannot stop the bot through normal controls

**What to do immediately:**

1. **Press Kill** on the dashboard (or send `/kill` via Telegram/Discord/Slack)
2. **Revoke your exchange API keys** by logging into your exchange directly
3. **Contact support immediately** with a description of what happened
4. **Do not resume trading** until support has reviewed the situation

### Non-Emergency (Normal Support)

Non-emergency issues include:

- Questions about dashboard features or metrics
- Help with configuration changes
- Understanding a trade or performance data
- Feature requests or feedback
- Billing questions
- Setting up notification bots

For these, send an email and we will respond within the timeframes listed above.

## Tips for Faster Resolution

1. **Be specific.** "The bot is not trading" is harder to diagnose than "No trades have been placed since 2:00 PM UTC on Feb 20, and the scanner shows confidence of 0.72 on BTC/USD with 4/9 confluence, but no trade was executed."

2. **Include screenshots.** A picture of your dashboard is worth a thousand words. Include the status area, the Risk Shield panel, and the AI Thought Feed if relevant.

3. **Note what changed.** If the issue started after you changed a setting, updated your API keys, or did anything different, mention it.

4. **Check the Troubleshooting guide first.** Many common issues have quick solutions: [Troubleshooting](Troubleshooting.md).
