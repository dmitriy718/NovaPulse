# FAQ

## Does the bot guarantee profits?

No. It is a risk-managed automated trader. Crypto markets are volatile and losses are possible.

## Why am I not seeing trades?

Most often:
- stale data
- high confluence/confidence thresholds
- spread filter blocking entries

## What is the "Thought Log"?

A record of the bot's analysis. It helps you understand why trades were taken or skipped.

## Can I run multiple exchanges?

Yes. Use the `TRADING_EXCHANGES` environment variable (comma-separated).

## Can I control the bot remotely?

Yes via Telegram (and optionally other integrations), but only authorized users/channels can issue commands.
