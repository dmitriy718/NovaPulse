# Billing and Subscription

If billing is enabled for your deployment:
- Your account is a tenant.
- Tenants can be `active`, `trialing`, `past_due`, or `canceled`.

If your tenant becomes inactive, API access may be blocked until payment issues are resolved.

If you believe you were blocked incorrectly, contact support with:
- tenant id
- timestamp of the error
- the error message
